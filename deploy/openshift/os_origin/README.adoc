== Installing OpenShift Origin

These instructions help you get a local copy of OpenShift Origin installed and running.
You can follow the link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc[OpenShift Origin instructions] to build from source.

=== Installing Origin Metrics

Because you need Origin Metrics installed (which contains Hawkular Metrics, the metric storage system, which does not come with OpenShift Origin when building from source), you have to run a few more steps. 

* Run `start-openshift.sh`
* Once it is fully started, run `afterstart-openshift.sh`

To fully and completely stop OpenShift, run `stop-openshift.sh`
