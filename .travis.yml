# Our source code layout is the full GOPATH location.
# This is different than how Travis expects so let's tell Travis
# to change its environment to point to the proper GOPATH.
# Once GOPATH and PATH are set properly, we install glide and use it to install deps.

install:
  - export GOPATH=${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}
  - export PATH=${GOPATH}/bin:${PATH}
  - go env
  - make install_glide
  - make install_deps
