# Workaround issue https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/issues/639
# Run this before_install and do not run "make install_glide" during the install.
before_install:
  - GLIDE_OS_ARCH=`go env GOHOSTOS`-`go env GOHOSTARCH`
  - GLIDE_TAG=$(curl -s https://glide.sh/version)
  - GLIDE_LATEST_RELEASE_URL="https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/releases/download/${GLIDE_TAG}/glide-${GLIDE_TAG}-${GLIDE_OS_ARCH}.tar.gz"
  - wget ${GLIDE_LATEST_RELEASE_URL} -O /tmp/glide.tar.gz
  - mkdir /tmp/glide
  - tar --directory=/tmp/glide -xvf /tmp/glide.tar.gz
  - export PATH=$PATH:/tmp/glide/${GLIDE_OS_ARCH}

# Our source code layout is the full GOPATH location.
# This is different than how Travis expects so let's tell Travis
# to change its environment to point to the proper GOPATH.
# Once GOPATH and PATH are set properly, we install glide and use it to install deps.

install:
  - export GOPATH=${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}
  - export PATH=${GOPATH}/bin:${PATH}
  - go env
#  - make install_glide
  - make install_deps
