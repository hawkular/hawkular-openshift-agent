# This removes the agent from OpenShift.

# This assumes the agent is deployed in the "openshift-infra" project
# (which is usually where it is), but if it is found in a different
# project, pass the project name to this script as its first argument.
#
# This script requires the "oc" OpenShift client. If it is not in the
# current PATH, it will be assumed it can be found in the source build.
# If there is no source build (i.e. you did not build OpenShift from
# source via the "build-openshift.sh" script) this script will abort.
